#[33] Should R be generated as a percentage of the solar wind or as a constant supplied by the user (Write B for background solar wind or C for constant standard deviation, then provide 3 constants seperated by a space indicating the percentage of background (0,1] or constant>0 for STERA, STERB and ACE [even if not assim.])
